## Synopsis

See also [`tapper_demo`](https://github.com/Financial-Times/tapper_demo)

### A Client
A client making a request:

```elixir
# start a new, sampled, trace, and root span;
# creates a 'client send' annotation on root span
# (defaults to type: :client) and a 'server address' (sa)
# binary annotation (because we pass the remote option with
# an endpoint)

# prepare remote endpoint metadata
service_host = %Tapper.Endpoint{service_name: "my-service"}

id = Tapper.start(name: "fetch", sample: true, remote: service_host, annotations: [
  Tapper.http_host("my.server.co.uk"),
  Tapper.http_path("/index"),
  Tapper.http_method("GET"),
  Tapper.tag("some-key", "some-value"),
  Tapper.client_send()
])

# ... do remote call ...

# add response details to span
Tapper.update_span(id, [
    Tapper.http_status_code(status_code),
    Tapper.client_receive()
])

# finish the trace (and the top-level span), with some detail about the operation
Tapper.finish(id, annotations: [
    tag("result", some_result)
])
```

### A Server

A server processing a request (usually performed via integration e.g. [`Tapper.Plug`](https://github.com/Financial-Times/tapper_plug)):

```elixir
#Â use propagated trace context (e.g. from Plug integration) and incoming Plug.Conn;
# adds a 'server receive' (sr) annotation (defaults to type: :server)
id = Tapper.join(trace_id, span_id, parent_span_id, sample, debug, annotations: [
  Tapper.client_address(%Tapper.Endpoint{ip: conn.remote_ip}), # equivalent to 'remote:' option
  Tapper.http_path(conn.request_path)
])

# NB because the server joined the trace, rather than starting it, 
# it must always start child spans for tracing anything it does, 
# rather than using the incoming span

# call another service in a child span, now as a client
id = Tapper.start_span(id, name: "fetch-details", annotations: [
    Tapper.http_path("/service/xx"),
    Tapper.http_host("a-service.com")
])
# ...
Tapper.update_span(id, Tapper.client_send())

# ... call service ...

Tapper.update_span(id, Tapper.client_receive())

# finish child span with some details about response
id = Tapper.finish_span(id, annotations: [
    Tapper.tag("userId", 1234),
    Tapper.http_status_code(200)
])

# perform some expensive local processing in a named local span:
id = Tapper.start_span(id, name: "process", local: "compute-result") # adds 'lc' binary annotation

# ... do processing ...

id = Tapper.finish_span(id)

# ... send response to client ...

# finish trace as far as this process is concerned
Tapper.finish(id, annotations: Tapper.server_send())
```

> NB `Tapper.start_span/2` and `Tapper.finish_span/2` return an updated id, whereas all other functions return the same id, so you don't need to propagate the id backwards down a call-chain to just add annotations, but you should propagate the id forwards when adding spans, and pair `finish_span/2` with the id from the corresponding `start_span/2`. Parallel spans can share the same starting id.

### The Alternative Contextual API

The above API is the *functional* API: you need the `Tapper.Id` on-hand whenever you use it. You may complain that this pollutes your API, or creates difficulties for integrations.

Whilst you may mitigate this yourself using process dictionaries, ETS, or pure functional approaches using closures, the `Tapper.Ctx` interface provides a version of the API that tracks the `Tapper.Id` for you, using Erlang's process dictionary. Erlang purists might hate it, but it does get the id out of your mainstream code:

```elixir

def my_main_function() do
  # ...
  Tapper.Ctx.start(name: "main", sample: true)
  # ...
  x = do_something_useful(a_useful_argument)
  # ...
  Tapper.Ctx.finish()
end

def do_something_useful(a_useful_argument) do  # no Tapper.Id!
  Tapper.Ctx.start_span(name: "do-something", annotations: tag("arg", a_useful_argument))
  # ...
  Tapper.Ctx.update_span(Tapper.wire_receive())
  # ...
  Tapper.Ctx.finish_span()
end
```

It's nearly identical to the functional API, but without explicitly passing the `Tapper.Id` around.

Behind the scenes, the `Tapper.Id` is managed using `Tapper.Ctx.put_context/1` and `Tapper.Ctx.context/0`. Use these functions 
directly to propagate the `Tapper.Id` across process boundaries.

See the `Tapper.Ctx` module for details, including details of options for debugging the inevitable incorrect usage in your code!

## Implementation

The Tapper API starts, and communicates with a supervised `GenServer` process (`Tapper.Tracer.Server`), with one server started per trace; all traces are thus isolated.

Once a trace has been started, all span operations and updates are performed asynchronously by sending a message to the server; this way there is minimum processing on the client side. One message is sent per `Tapper.start_span/2`, `Tapper.finish_span/2` or `Tapper.update_span/2`, tagged with the current timestamp at the point of the call.

When a trace is terminated with `Tapper.finish/2`, the server sends the trace to the configured collector (e.g. a Zipkin server), and exits normally.

If a trace is not terminated by an API call, Tapper will time-out after a pre-determined time since the last API operation (`ttl` option on trace creation, default 30s), and terminate the trace as if `Tapper.finish/2` was called, annotating the unfinished spans with a `timeout` annotation. Timeout will will also happen if the client process exits before finishing the trace.

If the API client starts spans in, or around, asynchronous processes, and exits before they have finished, it should call `Tapper.start_span/2` or `Tapper.update_span/2` with a `Tapper.async/0` annotation, or `Tapper.finish/2` passing the `async: true` option or annotation; async spans should be closed as normal by `Tapper.finish_span/2`, otherwise they will eventually be terminated by the TTL behaviour.

The API client is not effected by the termination, normally or otherwise, of a trace-server, and the trace-server is likewise isolated from the API client, i.e. there is a separate supervision tree. Thus if the API client crashes, then the span can still be reported. The trace-server monitors the API client process for abnormal termination, and annotates the trace with an error (TODO). If the trace-server crashes, any child spans and annotations registered with the server will be lost, but subsequent spans and the trace itself will be reported, since the supervisor will re-start the trace-server using the initial data from `Tapper.start/1` or `Tapper.join/6`.

The id returned from the Tapper API tracks the trace id, enabling messages to be sent to the right server, and span nesting, to ensure annotations are added to the correct span.

Tapper ids have an additional, unique, identifier, so if a server receives parallel requests within the same client span, the traces are recorded separately: each will start their own trace-server. In practice this should not happen, since clients should use a separate span
for each remote call, however this protects against unconformant clients.

## Installation

For the latest pre-release (and unstable) code, add github repo to your mix dependencies:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:tapper, github: "Financial-Times/tapper"}]
end
```

For release versions, the package can be installed by adding `tapper` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:tapper, "~> 0.6"}]
end
```

Under Elixir 1.4+ the `:tapper` application will be auto-discovered from your dependencies, so
there is no need to add `:tapper` to your application's `extra_applications` etc.

## Configuration

Tapper looks for the following application configuration settings under the `:tapper` key:

| attribute | type | description |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `system_id` | String.t | This application's id; used for `service_name` in default endpoint host used in annotations. |
| `ip`        | tuple    | This application's principle IPV4 or IPV6 address, as 4- or 8-tuple of ints; defaults to IP of first non-loopback interface, or `{127.0.0.1}` if none. |
| `port`      | integer  | This application's principle service port, for endpoint port in annotations; defaults to 0 |
| `reporter`  | `atom` \| `{atom, any}` \| `function/1` | Module implementing `Tapper.Reporter.Api` <sup>[1]</sup>, or function of arity 1 to use for reporting spans; defaults to `Tapper.Reporter.Console`. |

All keys support the Phoenix-style `{:system, var}` format, to allow lookup from shell environment variables, e.g. `{:system, "PORT"}` to read `PORT` environment variable<sup>[2]</sup>.

<sup>[1]</sup> If the reporter is given as `{module, arg}` it is expected to specify an OTP server to be started under Tapper's main supervisor.<br/>
<sup>[2]</sup> Tapper uses the [`DeferredConfig`](https://hexdocs.pm/deferred_config/readme.html) library to resolve all configuration under the `:tapper` key, so see its documention for more resolution options.

### Zipkin Reporter

The Zipkin reporter (`Tapper.Reporter.Zipkin`) has its own configuration:

| attribute | description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `collector_url` | full URL of Zipkin server api for receiving spans |
| `client_opts` | additional options for `HTTPoison` client, see `HTTPoison.Base.request/5` |

e.g. in `config.exs` (or `prod.exs` etc.)
```elixir
config :tapper,
    system_id: "my-application",
    reporter: Tapper.Reporter.Zipkin

config :tapper, Tapper.Reporter.Zipkin,
    collector_url: "http://localhost:9411/api/v1/spans"
```

### Other Reporters

| Module | Description |
| - | - |
| `Tapper.Reporter.AsyncReporter` | collects spans before sending them to another reporter |
| `Tapper.Reporter.Console` | just logs JSON spans |
| `Tapper.Reporter.Null` | reports and logs *nothing* |

### Custom Reporters

You can implement your own reporter module by implementing the `Tapper.Reporter.Api` behaviour.

This defines a function `ingest/1` that receives spans in the form of `Tapper.Protocol.Span` structs,
with timestamps and durations in microseconds. For JSON serialization, see `Tapper.Encoder.Json` which
encodes to a format compatible with Zipkin server.

The configuration's `reporter` property is usually either an `atom` specifying a simple module, or a 
supervisor-child-style `{module, args}` tuple specifying an OTP server to be started under Tapper's main 
supervisor. Additionally, it may be a 1-argument function which is useful for testing.

### Logging

Tapper adds a `trace_id` key to the `Logger` metadata on `Tapper.start/1` or `Tapper.join/6`, so if you want this in your logs, 
configure your logger formatter/backend to output this key, e.g.

```elixir
config :logger,
  format: "[$level] $metadata$message\n",
  metadata: [:trace_id],
```

Will output something like:

```log
[info] trace_id=b1db8e59c0f02152130c3fbb317d57fb  Something to log home about
```

Note that `trace_id` metadata is added regardless of whether the trace is sampled, so when you propagate the trace context for 
unsampled traces, you can still at least see the trace id in the logs, and track it across your system, which may be useful!

## Erlang and Time

It is recommended that you run the Erlang VM in [multi-time-warp mode](http://erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/time_correction.html#multi-time-warp-mode) for greater timing accuracy. This is achieved by setting the [`+C multi_time_warp`](http://erlang.org/doc/man/erl.html#+C_) command line option, e.g. by using the `ERL_FLAGS` environment var or `erl_opts` in your [Distillary release](https://hexdocs.pm/distillery/config/runtime.html#option-1-erl_opts).

The default time mode (`no_time_warp`) works well enough, but may introduce an error of up to 1% in time stamp and time duration measurements, due to the way it keeps the Erlang monotonic clock in sync with the system clock.
